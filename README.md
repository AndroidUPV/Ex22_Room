Lecture 06 - Local Storage

The app displays a list of contacts retrieved from local database.
A FloatingActionButton enables the user to enter the details of a new contact that will be stored in
the database.
By clicking on any entry in the list, the contact's details will be shown in a dialog, which will
enable updating and deleting the contact in the database.
The database is managed using the Room library, which is main-safe.
